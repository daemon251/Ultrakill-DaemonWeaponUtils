# OVERVIEW

This mod gives users the ability to:
1. Change the position, scale, and angle of weapons, on both a global and on a per-weapon basis
2. Use custom crosshairs for specific weapons 
3. Change colors of muzzle flashes, bullets, coins, projectiles, etc.
4. Change hitstop length settings

# WARNING - THIS MOD IS IN DEVLOPMENT

Right now this mod is poorly optimized and there are also probably plenty of bugs. I also haven't implemented everything that I have wanted to yet, but the mod is currently relatively stable.

If you encounter an issue, raise an issue on the github project or contact me at discord preferably through the New Blood discord ultrakill-modding channel at: daemon8363
